CS 530 Final Project

Included Files:
1) index.html - the sole html file which contains the structure and content of the app
2) peacefulride.css - a css file generated by themeroller 
	(https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/.  After generation, I edited the 
	document to tailor it to my application's needs.  
	NOTE: peacefulride.css is nested in the folder: themes.
3) I have included the other files which were included when I downloaded 
	peacefulride.css from themeroller.  I did not edit their content at all.


How to run:
1) Easiest way: the current version of the application (with the code that 
	is submitted here) can be found on my cs website: 
	https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~rr625/cs530/Project/
2) another option: unzip all files into a directory.  
	Right click on index.html and select Openwith->Chrome to view application. 
3) NOTE: the application is intended to be used primarily by mobile users, 
	because that is how people would engage the app on the quiet ride car.  
	As such, you'll want to either view the code with a mobile device 
	or turn on chrome's developer's tools to see how the page renders on a mobile device.

Thanks,
Rob
